<p><strong>New Feature: Role Queue</strong></p>

<p>Role Queue is an update to Overwatch&#8217;s matchmaking and queuing system that gives players the power to choose which role they play in games. In Competitive Play, players choose their role before finding a game. The matchmaking system will create a team that is comprised of two tanks, two supports, and two damage heroes. Upon entering the match, players select heroes to play within their chosen roles. At the end of a match, competitive players will return to the main menu and select their role before queuing into their next game. For more information about Role Queue, read the detailed <a href="https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/news/23060961/introducing-role-queue" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>

<p><strong>New Hero: Sigma (Tank)</strong></p>

<p>Sigma is an eccentric astrophysicist and volatile tank who gained the power to control gravity in an orbital experiment gone wrong. Manipulated by Talon and deployed as a living weapon, Sigma&#8217;s presence on the battlefield cannot be ignored. Sigma launches two Hyperspheres (gravitic charges), which bounce off walls and implode after a short duration, damaging enemies within a sizable radius. Using Experimental Barrier he propels a floating barrier to a location of his choosing and he can dismiss the barrier at any time. With Kinetic Grasp Sigma freezes incoming projectiles in midair, converting them into shields. Sigma uses Accretion to gather a mass of debris, then flings it at an enemy, knocking them down. Unleashing his full powers with Gravitic Flux, Sigma takes flight, lifts enemies in a targeted area, and launches them into the sky before slamming them back down.</p>

</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Healee</li>
	<li>Event Healing</li>
	<li>Host Player</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Developer Comment: A commonly requested feature for the Workshop is the ability to track healing, so we&#8217;ve added two new event types and three new values to make this possible. We&#8217;ve also added events to make it easier to detect players joining and leaving matches. To support the creation of administrator-style privileges for custom games, the owner of the game can now be detected using Host Player. Finally, we&#8217;ve added the ability to scale, invert, and rotate a player&#8217;s input throttle to make controlling characters in third person easier.</em></p>

<p></p>

<h2>HERO UPDATES</h2>

<p><strong>General</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Global ultimate cost increased 12%.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Developer Comment: Considering how high impact they are, ultimates are coming up too often. We are reducing how quickly they charge so fewer fights will be determined by ultimate usage.</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Slowing Effects: Instead of stacking together, friendly and hostile slowing effects are now separate, and movement speed will be determined by whichever is slower.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Developer Comment: This change will mostly impact heroes who slow themselves, such as when Widowmaker scopes or Reinhardt puts up his barrier. In these cases, hostile slowing effects, such as Symmetra&#8217;s turrets or Mei&#8217;s freezing will not hinder these heroes unless they stop slowing themselves or the hostile effect&#8217;s slow value surpasses their own.</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug in which full damage was not dealt by abilities that rapidly gain/lose targets, such as fast-tracking with Zarya's and Symmetra's primary fire beams.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Developer Comment:&#160; This is a fairly significant bug fix that can cause beam weapons to do much more damage in certain situations. In particular, Zarya and Symmetra will sometimes feel much more powerful as a result of this bug fix. We&#8217;ll be keeping a close eye on these heroes to make sure they don&#8217;t end up too strong.</em></p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Ashe</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Reload time per round decreased from 0.3 to 0.25 seconds.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Developer Comment: Ashe's full reload time felt overly restrictive. However, a long reload time is intended to balance out the power of her gun, so we want to be careful not to eliminate that completely.</em></p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Brigitte</strong></p>

<p>Inspire (Passive)</p>

<ul>
	<li>Healing amount increased from 100 to 130</li>
	<li>Self-healing from Inspire is now halved</li>
</ul>

<p>Repair Pack</p>

<ul>
	<li>Now has 3 charges</li>
	<li>Healing amount changed from 150 to 120</li>
	<li>Now heals over 2 seconds instead of instantly</li>
	<li>If you throw multiple packs at the same person, the current duration will be extended by 2 seconds</li>
</ul>

<p>Whip Shot</p>

<ul>
	<li>Out-going velocity increased from 60 to 80</li>
	<li>Retracting time reduced from 0.6 seconds to 0.3</li>
</ul>

<p>Barrier Shield</p>

<ul>
	<li>Barrier health reduced from 500 to 200</li>
</ul>

<p>Shield Bash</p>

<ul>
	<li>Stun duration reduced from 0.9 seconds to 0.75</li>
</ul>

<p>Rally</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ultimate cost increased 10%</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Developer Comment: The goal of these changes is to make Brigitte more of a primary healer for your team, at the cost of weakening her survivability. Since Brigitte will now be only one of two support heroes for your team, it is important that she can provide enough healing to be valuable in that role.</em></p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>D.Va</strong></p>

<p>Call Mech</p>

<ul>
	<li>Pilot ultimate cost reduced by 12%</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Developer Comment: This change is just meant to counteract the global increase in ultimate cost. The time it takes to generate a D.Va&#8217;s ultimate when out of her mech should remain the same as it was before this update.</em></p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Doomfist</strong></p>

<p>Melee</p>

<ul>
	<li>Quick melee no longer pauses ammo reload.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Developer Comment: This is a quality of life change which allows Doomfist to more freely use Quick Melee as part of his combos, without feeling punished for it.</em></p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Hanzo</strong></p>

<p>Storm Arrows</p>

<ul>
	<li>Storm Arrows ammo reduced from 6 to 5</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Developer Comment: The overall damage output of Storm Arrows was too high so we&#8217;re reducing the maximum number of shots.</em></p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Orisa</strong></p>

<p>Protective Barrier</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cooldown increased from 8 seconds to 9</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Developer Comment: A common point of feedback for playing against Orisa was that it doesn&#8217;t feel useful to shoot the barrier as it comes back so quickly. Increasing the cooldown of Protective Barrier will make destroying it more rewarding.</em>&#160;</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Reinhardt</strong></p>

<p>New Passive: &#8220;Steadfast&#8221;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Reduces knock back effects by 30%</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Developer Comment: As a frontline, melee-range tank Reinhardt was more adversely affected by knock back abilities than most heroes. To reduce some of this frustration and enable Reinhardt to more easily fulfill his role, he is now more resistant to being knocked back.</em></p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Sombra</strong></p>

<p>Hack</p>

<ul>
	<li>Duration on enemy players reduced from 6 to 5 seconds</li>
</ul>

<p>EMP</p>

<ul>
	<li>Activation time increased from 0.2 to 0.35 seconds</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Developer Comment: Hack is a potent disabling ability with a long duration. Reducing the duration slightly will make it feel less oppressive as the hacked player without greatly reducing its effectiveness. The increased activation time on EMP allows for more time to react and opens up more counterplay opportunities for the opposing team.</em></p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Symmetra</strong></p>

<p>Teleporter</p>

<ul>
	<li>Now lasts an infinite duration until destroyed</li>
	<li>Players can destroy their Teleporter with the ability 2 input</li>
	<li>Cooldown now starts when Teleporter is destroyed</li>
	<li>Maximum range increased from 25 to 30 meters</li>
	<li>Teleporter is destroyed if the entrance is more than 40 meters from the exit</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Developer Comment: Symmetra&#8217;s Teleporter is an interesting tool but often felt too restricting to use. Making the Teleporter last indefinitely opens up new opportunities for how Symmetra is used in various maps and group compositions.</em></p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Tracer</strong></p>

<p>Pulse Bomb</p>

<ul>
	<li>Damage increased from 300 to 350</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Developer Comment: Pulse Bomb was reduced in power some time ago to make sure it was not overly punishing to Tanks, which are much easier to stick the bomb to. While this is still a goal, we&#8217;re restoring some of this lost power to help deal with other hefty targets such as Bastion, or enemies with bonus armor from Brigitte.</em></p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Wrecking Ball</strong></p>

<p>Minefield</p>

<ul>
	<li>Increased projectile speed from 10 to 12, causing the mines to spread out more</li>
	<li>Reduced the activation time from 0.25 to 0.1 seconds</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Developer Comment: Wrecking Ball has a very active playstyle, but it often felt difficult to make good use out of his ultimate. This change allows him to spread out his Minefield further if he wants (especially from high in the air), while still allowing for a tighter cluster if he activates it near the ground.</em></p>

	<li>Fixed an issue so that targets hit by Rocket Punch will now go directly backwards, instead of maintaining any lateral momentum they had</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue so that targets that are immune to stun but not immune to knockback (Zarya's Particle Barrier, Zenyatta during Transcendence) are no longer able to affect knockback trajectory</li>
