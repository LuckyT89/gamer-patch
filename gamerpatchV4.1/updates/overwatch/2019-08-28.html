<h2>PATCH HIGHLIGHTS</h2>

<p><strong>New Feature: Hotfixing</strong></p>

<p>With this patch, the Overwatch client on all platforms can now automatically receive minor updates (hotfixes) without needing to be restarted. Hotfixes require online connectivity, access to disk, and sufficient disk space. In the event a hotfix can&#8217;t be received, you may encounter a message you can resolve via one of the following platform-specific support articles:</p>

<p><strong>New Feature: Shared Install (PTR and Live)</strong></p>

<p>The PTR and Live Overwatch PC clients can now share storage when installed to the same file path on disk. This should reduce the disk space required to install and update multiple clients. As a result, today&#8217;s PTR client should require only ~1.2GB of additional disk storage. Players with previous Overwatch PTR clients installed can uninstall and reinstall to a common disk location to benefit from this feature.</p>

<p><em>Note: Overwatch League Replay Viewer also supports shared installation with the PTR and Live clients.</em></p>
