<h3><u>GENERAL UPDATES</u></h3>

<p><strong>New Feature: &#8220;While You Wait&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>In this patch, we&#8217;re replacing our &#8220;Skirmish&#8221; mode with a brand-new feature called &#8220;While You Wait!&#8221; Now you can choose between a variety of game modes to play while you queue for a match</p>

<p>When in queue, players will now be prompted to pick from the following game modes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Practice Range &#8211; Practice your skills&#8212;solo or in a group&#8212;against training bots</li>
	<li>Skirmish - Spar with other players without keeping score</li>
	<li>Deathmatch - Compete for the top place on the scoreboard</li>
	<li>Custom Game &#8211; Select a custom game from the Custom Game Browser or create your own. (If you want your custom game to be available for everyone to play, make sure to choose the setting: "Allow players who are matchmaking.&#8221;)</li>
</ul>

<p>All While You Wait game modes are optional and can be accessed by a single player or as a group. Only your group leader can select the mode for their team.</p>

<p>Note: You don't have to leave your queue after a match ends to play another While You Wait mode. In order to access the While You Wait menu, click on the game mode you&#8217;re queued for and choose a While You Wait option from there.</p>

<h3><u>HERO UPDATES</u></h3>

<p><strong>General</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Armor damage reduction increased from 3 to 5</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Orisa</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Base armor increased from 200 to 250</li>
	<li>Protective Barrier health reduced from 900 to 600</li>
	<li>Fortify cooldown decreased from 10 seconds to 8 seconds</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sigma</strong></p>

<p>Experimental Barrier</p>

<ul>
	<li>Health reduced from 1500 to 900</li>
	<li>Barrier health regeneration rate reduced from 150 to 120 health per second</li>
</ul>

<p>Kinetic Grasp</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cooldown reduced from 13 seconds to 10 seconds</li>
	<li>Damage-to-shield gain ratio increased from 40% to 60%</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Reinhardt</strong></p>

<p>Barrier Field</p>

<ul>
	<li>Health reduced from 2000 to 1600</li>
	<li>Movement speed penalty reduced from 50% to 30%</li>
</ul>

<p>Steadfast passive knockback resistance increased from 30% to 50%</p>

<p><i>Developer Comment: The above changes to armor, Orisa, Sigma, and Reinhardt are aimed at decreasing the overall amount time players spend damaging barriers while improving the individual heroes in other areas. This is a significant change to the pace of the game and we&#8217;ll be monitoring these heroes closely to ensure they retain impactful gameplay in the tank role.</i></p>

<p><strong>Moira</strong></p>

<p>Biotic Grasp healing reduced from 4 to 3.25 (80 HP/s to 65 HP/s)</p>

<p><i>Developer Comment: Moira&#8217;s primary heal has proven to be too potent, largely due to its ability to heal multiple targets.</i></p>

<p><strong>D.Va</strong></p>

<p>Defense Matrix cooldown decreased from 2 seconds to 1.5 seconds</p>

<p><i>Developer Comment: With role locks in place there is some room to improve D.Va&#8217;s impact as a tank, so we&#8217;re partially reverting a previous change which increased Defense Matrix&#8217;s cooldown.</i></p>

<p><strong>Widowmaker</strong></p>

<p>Grappling Hook cooldown increased from 10 to 12 seconds</p>

<p><i>Developer Comment: With barriers having less uptime, Widowmaker will be even more effective at locking down long sight lines. This change weakens her mobility so she can still be reasonably countered.</i></p>

<p><strong>Torbj&#246;rn</strong></p>

<p>Overload cooldown decreased from 12 to 10 seconds</p>

<p><i>Developer Comment: Torbj&#246;rn has difficulty in extended team fights once his turret is eliminated and Overload has been used. This change allows Torbj&#246;rn to be able to rely on his Overload more often.</i></p>

<p><strong>Genji</strong></p>

<p>Ammo increased from 24 to 30</p>

<p><i>Developer Comment: As average hero survivability has gone up over time, Genji can sometimes have difficulty finishing off his targets. Loosening his ammunition constraints will help give him a small boost.</i></p>

<p><strong>Zarya</strong></p>

<p>Particle Cannon (Secondary Fire)</p>

<ul>
	<li>Explosion radius increased from 2 to 2.5 meters</li>
	<li>Ammo cost decreased from 25 to 20</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Developer Comment: Zarya&#8217;s overall damage output is in a good spot but the secondary fire was left feeling a little too weak after the last set of changes.</i></p>
