<h3><u>GENERAL UPDATES</u></h3>

<p><strong>New Feature: Share Replays</strong></p>

<p>Players can now share their in-game replays with others!</p>

<p>A replay is shared via an alphanumeric code typically 6 characters long. The code can be shared however you want: in game, on forums, over social media. Another player can input that code and watch your replay. Codes are valid until the next patch.</p>

<p>The replay system has also received several improvements:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Pin up to 10 replays to keep until the next patch. Unpin a replay to make room for a different replay</li>
	<li>The 10 most recently imported replay codes are tracked. This allows you to watch the same imported replay again without retyping the code</li>
	<li>There is a new note field for each replay entry, allowing you to add descriptions or notes for yourself</li>
</ul>
&#160;

<p><strong>General Updates</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>In game friend requests will now only display in game once per session</li>
	<li>RealID friend requests will only show RealID names in game if you have recently played with that player</li>
	<li>The initial Assemble Heroes timer for games using the Assault, Hybrid, Control, and Payload game modes has been further reduced from 35 to 30 seconds</li>
	<li>In the Assault, Payload, and Hybrid game modes for Competitive Play, when both teams complete a round of offense and have more than 2 minutes of time bank then each team&#8217;s time bank is equally reduced until one of the teams has a 2 minutes remaining
	<ul>
		<li>Example: If Team A completes a round of offense on Volskaya with 4:37 remaining in their time bank, and Team B completes their round on offense with 2:50 remaining, then 50 seconds is removed from each team&#8217;s timebank. This leaves the teams tied 2-2 and Team A with 3:47 remaining and Team B with 2:00 remaining</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
