<h3><u>GENERAL UPDATES</u></h3>

<p><strong>New Feature: Hero Pools</strong></p>

<p>We will be introducing Hero Pools starting in Season 21 of Competitive Play. Much like Map Pools, rather than having all heroes available for play at all times, a weekly changing list of heroes will be available. The list will include the vast majority of the hero roster, with only a few being excluded during any given week. We think this feature will help keep Competitive Play interesting, as team compositions will change more frequently during a season.</p>

<p>It is important to note that Hero Pools is a new feature that may not last past this initial season. Throughout the season, we will be adjusting the types of Hero Pools available. In addition, it is possible we will also adjust the frequency with which they change.</p>

<p><strong>New Feature: Experimental Changes &amp; 1-3-2 &#8220;Triple Damage&#8221; Ruleset</strong></p>

<p>We've added a new card labeled "Experimental" within the Play menu where Overwatch players can try new balance updates, rulesets, and game modes that might be awesome or might not ever make it past the "Experimental" stage. Unlike the PTR, the Experimental area is not intended to be used for bug and stability testing. Players from all platforms will be able to test major gameplay changes, with the hope that you'll provide us with feedback on your experience. Some of the changes we test will be vastly different than what you're used to, but we want to reiterate that the changes we will be testing are not guaranteed to reach the retail version you're used to playing. Experimental will not always be available: it will come and go as we have things we'd like you to try and may sometimes only last for brief periods of time.</p>

<p>Since Experimental is available in the retail version of Overwatch, you will be able to earn experience and progress towards win-based event unlocks by participating.</p>

<p>The first set of changes we want to test is a mode titled "Triple Damage," which modifies the existing 2-2-2 Role Queue system. In this mode, teams will be composed of 1 tank, 3 damage, and 2 support heroes. One of our hopes with this test is to see if this change reduces queue times for the Damage role.</p>

<p><b><i>HERO CHANGES TO SUPPORT EACH TEAM HAVING ONLY ONE TANK (ONLY IN EXPERIMENTAL)</i></b></p>

<p><b>Note that the balance changes below only affect the "Triple Damage" Experimental mode.</b></p>

<h3><u>WORKSHOP UPDATES</u></h3>

<p><strong>New Workshop Features</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Custom Game Maps:
	<ul>
		<li>Workshop Chamber</li>
		<li>Workshop Island</li>
		<li>Workshop Expanse</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Script Diagnostics Panel</li>
	<li>Subroutines</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Developer Comments:</i></p>

<ul>
	<li><i>We&#8217;ve added the ability for rules to call subroutines (which are rules with a Subroutine event type) using the new Call Subroutine action. When a subroutine is called, execution is temporarily shifted to another rule while keeping contextual values such as Event Player, Attacker, and Victim the same. When the subroutine rule finishes or aborts, the original rule picks up where it left off. Subroutines may call other subroutines or even themselves, though we enforce a maximum depth of 1024 calls. Waits are allowed in subroutines, and if such a Wait is ever interrupted (and the interruption isn&#8217;t being ignored by the Wait), the entire call stack is aborted, and the original rule is restarted or aborted.</i></li>
	<li><i>Subroutine rules may also be started in parallel using the Start Rule action. Unlike with the Call Subroutine action, the original rule continues execution immediately, and the subroutine rule executes on its own some time later (either on the same frame if below the original rule or on the next frame if above). As with Call Subroutine, contextual values such as Event Player, Attacker, and Victim are copied over to the subroutine rule.</i></li>
	<li><i>Subroutine names can be added and modified using a new button at the top of the editor.</i></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New Workshop Actions</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Start Healing Modification</li>
	<li>Stop Healing Modification</li>
	<li>Stop All Healing Modifications</li>
	<li>Enable Inspector Recording</li>
	<li>Disable Inspector Recording</li>
	<li>If</li>
	<li>Else If</li>
	<li>Else</li>
	<li>While</li>
	<li>End</li>
	<li>For Global Variable</li>
	<li>For Player Variable</li>
	<li>Call Subroutine</li>
	<li>Start Rule</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Developer Comments:</i></p>

<ul>
	<li><i>To make writing logic easier, we&#8217;ve added several new flow control actions (If, Else If, Else, While, End, For Global Variable, and For Player Variable). These actions are optimized to cause minimal server load. When using them, the editor will indent to show where sections of logic start and stop. To conclude such an indented section, use the End action. When in doubt, each action has a detailed tool tip explaining how it is used. These tool tips can be displayed by hovering over the action name or by pressing the appropriate controller button.</i></li>
	<li><i>The Enable and Disable Inspector Recording actions offer two benefits: First, they allow selective debugging of only those sections of a script that you need to study. Second, disabling recording can reduce server load, especially when setting or modifying arrays.</i></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New Workshop Values</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Event Was Health Pack</li>
	<li>Last Healing Modification ID</li>

	<li>Added Sort Order Reevaluation Options for Create HUD Text</li>
	<li>The Skip and Skip If actions now accept 0 for the number of actions to skip (so they just go on to the next action)</li>
	<li>A Wait action is no longer required before a Loop</li>
	<li>Straightened Beam Effects</li>
	<li>Set Status/Clear Status behavior merged with gameplay stuns (e.g. Clear Status can now clear a freeze that was caused by gameplay, not just a freeze set via Workshop itself)</li>
</ul>

	<li>Loop If</li>
	<li>Abort</li>
	<li>Abort If</li>
	<li>Skip</li>
	<li>Skip If</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Developer Comments:</i></p>

<ul>
	<li><i>Variable manipulation and flow control actions previously caused high server load, so we spent some time making them more lightweight. When combined with the new Disable Inspector Recording action, these changes may result in significant reduction in server load for Workshop modes that rely on heavy variable logic, particularly those that manipulate arrays. In light of these changes, we&#8217;re removing the restriction that requires a Wait action before a Loop, though be advised that excessive looping in a single frame can still cause server load issues, especially when using actions other than those listed above. Note that setting or modifying multiple player variables with a single action (by providing an array of players) is not optimized, nor is setting or modifying a variable that is ever used by a Chase action. Finally, keep in mind that some values (such as the Ray Cast values) can cause quite a bit of server load on their own, even if using the optimized actions above.</i></li>
</ul>
