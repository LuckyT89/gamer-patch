<p><strong>Brigitte</strong></p>

<p>Repair Pack</p>

<ul>
	<li>Armor over-heal reduced from 75 armor to 50 armor</li>
	<li>HPS decreased from 60 to 55</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Developer Comment: On top of the high utility Brigitte brings to her team, she also dishes out a ton of healing and armor. We&#8217;re reducing some of this healing and armor to help keep her in line with the other healers.</i></p>

<p><strong>Symmetra</strong></p>

<p>Photon Projector (Secondary Fire)</p>

<ul>
	<li>Damage increased from 120 to 140</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Developer Comment: Increasing Photon Projectors max damage allows Symmetra to play more effectively at a safer range when necessary.</i></p>

<p><strong>Widowmaker</strong></p>

<p>Widow&#8217;s Kiss</p>

<ul>
	<li>Full charge time for scoped shots increased from 0.75 sec to 0.9 sec</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Developer Comment: Widowmaker has become stronger over time following changes to other heroes, such as power reductions to barriers. This change is intended to slow down her shots, reducing her overall DPS.</i></p>

<p><strong>Wrecking Ball</strong></p>

<p>Piledriver</p>

<ul>
	<li>Affected players&#8217; loss of air control reduced from 1 second to 0.5 seconds</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Developer Comment: This change allows Wrecking Ball&#8217;s enemies to regain control of their movement more quickly to try and avoid attacks, making Piledriver combos a bit less deadly.</i></p>
