<h2>WORKSHOP UPDATES</h2>

<p><strong>General</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Added the ability for scripters to measure the server performance of the current game instance.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
		<li>Three new values make this possible:
		<ul>
			<li>Server Load - Provides a percentage representing the CPU load of the current game instance.</li>
			<li>Server Load Average - Provides a percentage representing the average CPU load of the current game instance over the last two seconds.</li>
			<li>Server Load Peak - Provides a percentage representing the highest CPU load of the current game instance over the last two seconds.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>As these numbers approach or exceed 100, it becomes increasingly likely that the game instance will be shut down because it is consuming too many resources.</li>
		<li>A new preset example displays these values as HUD text in the upper-left corner of the screen. The rule in the preset can be copied into other scripts to help identify performance problem areas.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>When a game instance shuts down due to excessive Workshop script load, a new error message is displayed in the chat window (instead of the &#8220;unexpected error&#8221; message).</li>
	<li>Additional strings added.</li>
</ul>
